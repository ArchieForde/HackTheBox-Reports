# Hack The Box Lab documentation

## Objective

The objective of these HackTheBox labs is to explore and enhance my cybersecurity skills through hands-on exercises and challenges. By engaging with a variety of virtual machines, systems, and security-related tasks, I aim to deepen my understanding of penetration testing, network security, vulnerability analysis, exploitation techniques and thorough documentation. These labs will serve as a practical platform to test my knowledge, develop problem-solving strategies, and simulate real-world cyberattack scenarios, ultimately preparing me for a career in cybersecurity and penetration testing. Additionally, I will document my approach to each challenge, outlining the tools, techniques, and methodologies used, to foster better learning and sharing of knowledge.

### Skills Learned

- Penetration Testing: Gained practical experience in identifying vulnerabilities and exploiting weaknesses in various systems through HackTheBox challenges.

- Network Security: Enhanced understanding of network protocols, firewall configurations, and the detection of network-based vulnerabilities and intrusions.

- Vulnerability Assessment: Learned to use tools like Nmap, Burp Suite, and others to scan for and assess system vulnerabilities, with a focus on real-world attack vectors.

- Exploitation Techniques: Developing expertise in exploiting common vulnerabilities such as SQL injection, buffer overflows, and remote code execution (RCE) in controlled environments.

- Cryptography and Encryption: Improved skills in breaking and implementing cryptographic algorithms as part of these labs.

- Malware Analysis: Gained knowledge in reverse engineering and analyzing malware behavior to understand attack mechanisms and mitigation strategies.

- Incident Response: Built experience in investigating compromised systems, conducting forensic analysis, and tracing attack patterns.

- Problem-Solving: Strengthened critical thinking and problem-solving abilities by approaching complex cybersecurity challenges with persistence and creativity.

- Reporting and Documentation: Learned to document and present findings in a clear and concise manner, emphasizing the steps taken, tools used, and lessons learned from each challenge or project.

- Continuous Learning: Cultivated a mindset of ongoing learning and adapting to new tools, techniques, and vulnerabilities, staying up to date with the evolving cybersecurity landscape.

### Tools that may be used

1. Nmap:
A versatile network scanning tool essential for discovering hosts, services, and open ports on target machines.

2. Burp Suite:
A critical tool for web application penetration testing, allowing you to intercept and modify web traffic, scan for vulnerabilities like SQL injection, and identify security flaws in web applications.

3. Metasploit:
A powerful exploitation framework that allows you to develop and execute exploits against target systems, commonly used for both discovering vulnerabilities and conducting post-exploitation.

4. Hydra:
A fast and efficient brute-force tool used for cracking login credentials through various protocols (HTTP, FTP, SSH, etc.).

5. John the Ripper:
A password cracking tool used to break encrypted passwords using dictionary-based and brute-force attacks.

6. Netcat (nc):
A fundamental tool for establishing reverse shells and interacting with remote machines, commonly used for post-exploitation tasks.

7. Gobuster:
A directory and file brute-forcing tool, useful for finding hidden resources on web servers by guessing common paths.

8. Wireshark:
A network packet analyzer essential for capturing and inspecting network traffic to identify potential vulnerabilities or malicious activity.

9. Aircrack-ng:
A suite of tools for wireless network penetration testing, particularly useful for cracking WEP and WPA-PSK keys.

10. OWASP ZAP (Zed Attack Proxy):
A popular web application security scanner used to find vulnerabilities such as cross-site scripting (XSS) and SQL injection in web applications.
